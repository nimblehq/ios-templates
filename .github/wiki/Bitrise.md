# Bitrise
Use the Bitrise template to start a new project with Bitrise as the CI/CD tool.

## Workflows and Steps

Out of the box, the Bitrise Template has the following workflows and steps:

## Trigger Map

| Workflow                | Trigger                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| test                    | Create or Update a PR   |
| deploy_staging          | Push branch `develop`   |
| deploy_release_firebase | Push branch `release/*` |
| deploy_app_store        | Push branch `master`/`main`    |

## Environment and Secrets
### App Environtment Variables
- BITRISE_PROJECT_PATH
> e.g., ExampleApp.xcodeproj or in case you're using CocoaPod, it is ExampleApp.xcworkspace.

- TEAM_ID
> This is your Apple Team ID (e.g., T3T4E84BAA), you can find it in `Membership` at Apple developer portal.

- MATCH_REPO_URL
> Link to a repository that contains your Fastlane Match it can be either HTTPS or SSH link (e.g., https://github.com/nimblehq/fastlane-match.git)

- BUILD NUMBER OFFSET

> Set this variable value in the **Set Xcode Project Build Number** step in Bitrise in case you switch to Bitrise from another CI/CD and want to keep the build number of the application. 

### Workflow Environment Variables
All four workflows have their own variables:

- BUNDLE_ID
> e.g., com.nimblehq.exampleApp

- BITRISE_SCHEME
> Your build scheme in Xcode (e.g., ExampleApp UAT, ExampleApp Staging, or ExampleApp)

*Depending on which workflow, the value of those variables may differ from other workflows.*

### Secrets

- MATCH_PASSWORD
> This is an encryption password for the Match Repo
